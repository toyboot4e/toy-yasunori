** THIS PROJECT IS YASUNORIZED

This project is yasunorized its definition. Or it is not actively yasunorized.

Do not try to find anything useful; YOU CAN'T EVEN BUILD THE PROJECT. Contact with active yasunori develpers for real-world yasunori projects.

** How to run

THIS REPOSITORY IS NOT REPRODUCIBLE. How did I even build =h-raylib=? What the hell, it doesn't deserve yasunori.
